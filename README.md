Super ðŸŒ  mega solution in ðŸŒ  3 milliseconds ðŸŒ  come to my tavern ðŸŒ  if you are not too lazy!!! ðŸ’˜

Explanation:

This code defines a class Solution with a public member function jump that takes a reference to a vector of integers nums as input and returns an integer.
It begins with synchronization optimization for input and output streams to make the software run faster.
It calculates the size of the input vector nums.
If the size is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 0, as no jumps are needed.
Otherwise, it initializes variables for steps, maximum length, and minimum length.
It then iterates through the elements of the vector nums.
Within the loop, it updates the maximum reachable position (maxLength) based on the current index and value of nums[i].
If the current index equals the minimum length, it means a new jump is needed. So, the minimum length is updated to the maximum reachable position, and the number of steps is incremented.
The loop continues until the minimum length is greater than or equal to the size of the array minus 1.
Finally, it returns the number of steps required to reach the end of the array.
